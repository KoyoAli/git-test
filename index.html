          <p> Hey I am KoyoAli and I love Anime, Manga and Eroges. However one thing that I have always been a unsatisfied with is the lack of good reccomedation
            sites for Animanga on the interenet, so to tackle this I have specificly designed this one of a kind Algo that takes your MAL/Anilist usernames and by using
            use Lists as Parameteres it predicts what Anime suit your taste the most. It gives you reccomedations that you would simply not find on most Anime recc websites
            as most of them are plauged by the same Mainstream anime reccs that any animemanga fan worth his salt has watched/read already.

            So I present to you "Koyo AI", simply write your MAL or Anilist username in the respective field and press the start button and let this tool do its magic. Good Luck
